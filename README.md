### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a movie streaming dashboard using JavaScript and React.

### Brief

You are the owner of a movie theater in **Thikkiiana City,** on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection and are asking for something completely different - they want to see what's playing on Earth. Wookies are the main exporter of Computer Technology for the New Republic so naturally you roll up your sleeves and get to work. You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **JavaScript**
    -   Framework: **React**
-   Build out the project to the designs inside the `/Designs` folder
-   Connect your application to the **CodeSubmit Movie Database** at `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies`
-   For authentication pass the `"Authorization: Bearer Wookie2021"` header
-   Parse the API response and display the results as outlined in the design. **Make sure to group movies by categories**.
-   Implement a detail view for the movies in the list
-   Make sure that inking to detail pages as well as bookmarking works as expected
-   Implement search by connecting to `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies?q=<search_term>`

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. 

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The Forager Team

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
